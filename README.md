# JPA library example

This is a simple example application about creating JPA backed Java EE application
with rich Vaadin based UI. To avoid writing JQPL or Criteria queries manually, we 
also use two awesome JPA helper libraries, 
[DeltaSpike Data](https://deltaspike.apache.org/documentation/data.html) and 
[QueryDSL](http://www.querydsl.com).

To get this running execute "mvn wildfly:run" to launch this locally on Wildfly 
server. Or deploy to any other Java EE 7 server.
